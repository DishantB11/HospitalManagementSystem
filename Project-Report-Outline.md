## 2. Introduction
Brief overview of the Hospital Management System and its objectives.

## 3. Problem Statement
In many small to mid-sized healthcare facilities, inefficient manual or fragmented digital systems lead to errors in patient record keeping, slow appointment scheduling, and poor tracking of staff duties and resource utilization. This results in decreased patient care quality, increased operational costs, and security vulnerabilities related to sensitive medical data.

## 4. Functional Requirements
### 4.1 Major Functional Modules:
1. **Patient Management Module**
    - Patient registration
    - Patient record viewing
    - Patient information updates

2. **Doctor Management Module**
    - Doctor profile management
    - Specialization-based search
    - Doctor availability tracking

3. **Appointment Management Module**
    - Schedule appointments
    - View appointment history
    - Cancel appointments

### 4.2 Input/Output Structure:
- Input: Patient/Doctor details, appointment requests
- Output: Confirmation messages, lists, system reports

## 5. Non-functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Responsive menu system
2. **Usability**: Intuitive text-based interface
3. **Reliability**: Error handling for invalid inputs
4. **Maintainability**: Modular code structure with separate packages
5. **Security**: Input validation and data integrity

## 6. System Architecture
- **Model Layer**: Patient, Doctor, Appointment classes
- **Service Layer**: Business logic (PatientService, DoctorService, AppointmentService)
- **Main Layer**: User interface and menu system

## 7. Design Diagrams
*(You can create these diagrams using draw.io or similar tools)*

## 8. Implementation Details
- Java programming language
- Object-oriented design
- Package-based modular architecture
- ArrayList for data storage
- LocalDateTime for appointment scheduling

## 9. Testing Approach
- Manual testing through menu options
- Input validation testing
- Boundary condition testing

## 10. Challenges Faced
- Managing object relationships
- Date/time handling
- Menu navigation logic

## 11. Learnings & Key Takeaways
- Java OOP concepts implementation
- Package organization
- Service layer pattern
- Git version control
