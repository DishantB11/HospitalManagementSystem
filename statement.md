# Hospital Management System

## Problem Statement
In many small to mid-sized healthcare facilities, inefficient manual or fragmented digital systems lead to errors in patient record keeping, slow appointment scheduling, and poor tracking of staff duties and resource utilization. This results in decreased patient care quality, increased operational costs, and security vulnerabilities related to sensitive medical data.

## Scope of the Project
The project focuses on core administrative and clinical workflows within a single hospital/clinic setting, including:
- User authentication and role management
- Patient data management (registration, medical history)
- Doctor profile management
- Appointment scheduling and tracking
- Basic reporting and system analytics

### Out of Scope:
- Direct integration with payment gateways
- Insurance provider integrations
- Complex medical imaging systems
- Pharmacy inventory management

## Target Users
1. **Administrative Staff**: Manage user accounts, hospital staff records, and system configuration
2. **Doctors/Nurses (Clinical Staff)**: View patient histories, update treatments, manage schedules
3. **Patients**: Book appointments, view basic medical history, manage contact information

## High-Level Features
1. **User Management**: Role-based access control
2. **Patient Portal**: Registration, profile management, appointment booking
3. **Doctor Portal**: Profile management, schedule viewing, patient history access
4. **Appointment System**: Scheduling, reminders, status tracking
5. **Reporting**: Basic analytics and system overview
